# Wikipedia Parser
This is a tool for processing Wikipedia articles and extracting important information from them as plaintext.

## Instructions for use
1. Run `./download.sh` to download all of Wikipedia as a single xml file. This will likely take a long time
2. Run `cargo run --release` to run the program

Note that this is still a work in progress and does not yet output totally plaintext files
