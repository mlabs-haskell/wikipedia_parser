'''''...Baby One More Time''''' is the debut studio album by American singer [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on January 12, 1999, by [[Jive Records]]. Spears had been a child performer on ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club#1989–1994 revival: The All-New Mickey Mouse Club|The All-New Mickey Mouse Club]]'' from 1993 to 1994, and was looking to expand her career as a teen singer. After being turned away by several record companies, Spears signed with Jive for a multi-album deal in 1997. She travelled to Sweden to collaborate with producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], who had been writing songs with producer [[Denniz Pop]] and others, for ''...Baby One More Time''. Their collaboration created a [[Pop music|pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[dance-pop]], and [[teen pop]] record, with Spears later saying that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. The album was completed in June 1998.

Upon its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' garnered mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], with many praising its commercial appeal but deeming it silly and premature. Despite its initial mixed reception, it helped Spears receive a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] (2000). Retrospectively, it has been hailed for its major impact on [[Popular culture|pop culture]], citing it as one of the most influential pop records of all time. A massive global commercial success, it made Spears the fifth artist under the age of 18 to top the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|14× platinum (diamond)]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Spears's best-selling album, it has sold over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], as well as the [[List of best-selling albums by women|best-selling debut album by a female artist]].

''...Baby One More Time'' produced five singles. The lead single, "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", brought Spears tremendous global success, reaching number one in most countries it charted in and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide#Best-selling physical singles|best-selling physical singles of all time]]. In 2020, it was named the greatest debut single of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Subsequent singles "[[Sometimes (Britney Spears song)|Sometimes]]" and "[[Born to Make You Happy]]" peaked within the top ten in most international countries while "[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]" became Spears's second US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten hit. Spears heavily promoted the album through interviews and televised performances. Furthermore, she embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] (1999) and later continued with [[(You Drive Me) Crazy Tour]] (2000).

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with then-manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Her mother, [[Lynne Spears]], asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with an [[Audio engineering|audio engineer]]. Spears traveled from her hometown [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], to New York City with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]] or another [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref name="hughes145">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}</ref> Jive's senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated: "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name="rs1">{{cite magazine|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Daly|first=Steven|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-254871/|issn=0035-791X|access-date=June 2, 2022|archive-date=July 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726051137/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-254871/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jive soon appointed Britney to work with producer [[Eric Foster White]] for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> One of the first songs Spears recorded with Foster White was "[[From the Bottom of My Broken Heart]]", which was released as the album's 4th single. Foster White also produced "Autumn Goodbye", which was the [[B-side]] to Spears' debut single "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]". During the same session for "Autumn Goodbye", Spears and Foster White also worked on a song called "Love Is On", which ultimately did not make the album and was later given to [[Sharon Cuneta]]. Spears recorded a lot of material with [[Eric Foster White]], such as "Autumn Goodbye", "E-Mail My Heart", "[[From the Bottom of My Broken Heart]]", "I'm So Curious", "I Will Still Love You", "Way It Is Loving You", "I'll Be There For You", "Soda Pop", "Thinkin' About You", "Nothing Less Than Real", "Wishing on a Falling Star" and a cover of "[[You Got It All (The Jets song)#Britney Spears version|You Got It All]]" by [[The Jets (Minnesota band)|the Jets]].<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media|last=Spears|first=Britney|author-link=Britney Spears|title=...Baby One More Time|type=CD liner notes|publisher=[[Jive Records]]|year=1999}}</ref> She also recorded a cover of [[Sonny & Cher]]'s 1967 single "[[The Beat Goes On (Sonny & Cher song)|The Beat Goes On]]".<ref name="liner" /> White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production, while additional production was handled by English electronic music group [[All Seeing I]].<ref name="liner" /> After hearing the material, Jive Records president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full studio album.<ref name="Hughes 2005 147" />

Spears flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, where half of ''...Baby One More Time'' was recorded from May 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jorgenelofsson.com/biography/the-story-behind-britney-spears-sometimes/|title=The story behind Britney Spears' "Sometimes"|website=jorgenelofsson.com|access-date=September 9, 2019|archive-date=October 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021095706/http://www.jorgenelofsson.com/biography/the-story-behind-britney-spears-sometimes/|url-status=live}}</ref> with producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], and contributions from others, including songwriting from [[Denniz Pop]], who was too ill to attend any recording sessions.{{efn|Denniz Pop had [[stomach cancer]] and died on August 30, 1998.

==Music and lyrics==
Spears originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger &ndash; more [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]" for ''...Baby One More Time'', but acquiesced to the wishes of her label, since "It made more sense to go [[Pop music|pop]], because I can dance to it—it's more me."<ref name="rs1" /> The album opens with its lead single, "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", a [[teen pop]] and [[dance-pop]] song beginning with a three-note [[motif (music)|motif]] in the bass range of the piano. Its opening was compared to many other songs, such as "[[We Will Rock You]]" (1977), "[[Start Me Up]]" (1981), "[[These Words]]" (2004) and the theme song of the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' due to the fact the track "makes its presence known in exactly one second".<ref name="blender" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|title=Britney Spears Baby One More Time – Sheet Music|work=Music Notes|date=December 15, 1999|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|access-date=November 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225042903/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|archive-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-us-cd-single-r377377|title=...Baby One More Time (US CD Single) – Britney Spears|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=September 26, 2011|date=April 20, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513122455/http://www.allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-us-cd-single-r377377|archive-date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> According to ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', "...Baby One More Time" is composed of "[[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] guitar lines and [[electrocardiography|EKG]]-machine bass-slaps".<ref name="blender" /> Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of ''Girl Culture: Studying Girl Culture: A Readers' Guide'' (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song "gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend."<ref>{{harvnb|Mitchell|Reid-Walsh|2008|p=547}}</ref> "[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]" runs through a [[down-tempo|moderately slow]] dance [[beat (music)|beat]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0028943|title=Britney Spears (You Drive Me) Crazy – Sheet Music|work=Music Notes|date=February 25, 2000|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|access-date=November 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225042904/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0028943|archive-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref> and has an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[melody]] mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals.<ref>{{harvnb|Bennett|Peterson|2004|p=92}}</ref> "[[Sometimes (Britney Spears song)|Sometimes]]" is a [[Ballad (music)|ballad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/09/15/snooki-britney-spears/|title=Snooki Lip-Synchs To Britney Spears' 'Sometimes'|last=Ryan|first=Chris|date=September 15, 2010|website=MTV|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|access-date=March 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312000909/http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/09/15/snooki-britney-spears/|archive-date=March 12, 2014}}</ref> which Spears begins with the lines "You tell me you're in love with me / That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But every time you come too close I move away".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0026598|title=Britney Spears – Sometimes Sheet Music (Digital Download)|work=Music Notes|date=December 15, 1999|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|access-date=November 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529192123/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0026598|archive-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] noted the song has "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent [[Eurodance|euro-dance]] rhythm."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-mw0000045914|title=Britney Spears ...Baby One More Time – Album Review|date=January 12, 1999|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=April 12, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231041334/http://www.allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-r384763/review|archive-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

''...Baby One More Time'' received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] upon its release. In a positive review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] gave the album four out of five stars.<ref name="allmusic"/> Paul Verna from [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] considered the album "a [[Contemporary hit radio|top 40]]-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut".<ref name="spotlightbill">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q0EAAAAMBAJ|title=Albums|date=January 30, 1999|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=October 8, 2011|last=Verna|first=Paul|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] highlighted the title track and "Soda Pop" while summing the album up as a "[[girl next door]]" version of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name="christgau"/> Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]] said he "was surprised in more ways than one" with his first listening of ''...Baby One More Time'', commenting he "expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos."<ref name="popology" />

Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album two stars out of five,<ref name="...Baby One More Time Album Review" /> and compared the album's sound to early hits of [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Samantha Fox]].<ref name="...Baby One More Time Album Review" /> Walters also said that "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', is pure spam."<ref name="...Baby One More Time Album Review" /> An ''[[NME]]'' reviewer rated ''...Baby One More Time'' one out of ten, saying that "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career".<ref name="nme">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/britney-spears/853|title=...Baby One More Time|date=March 6, 1999|access-date=October 4, 2011|work=[[NME]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201446/http://www.nme.com/reviews/britney-spears/853|archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> He also found the album premature, commenting: "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!"<ref name="nme" /> Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that "with the exception of the terrific title track, ''...Baby One More Time'' is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed."<ref name="sputnik">{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/5825/Britney-Spears-...Baby-One-More-Time/|title=Britney Spears – ...Baby One More Time (staff review)|author=Murray, Amanda|date=March 26, 2006|website=Sputnikmusic|access-date=December 25, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131029185644/http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/5825/Britney-Spears-...Baby-One-More-Time/|archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref>
