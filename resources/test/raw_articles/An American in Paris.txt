It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]] and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the ''{{Lang|fr|[[Années folles]]}}''.

Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |access-date=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017</ref> It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] following the earlier success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924).<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin "''An American in Paris''"], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref> He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|author-link=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The George Gershwin Reader|editor1-last=Wyatt|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=John Andrew|date=2004|author=[[Deems Taylor]]|chapter=33.

==Background==
Although the story is likely apocryphal,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Charles |url=https://archive.org/details/gershwinhislifem00sch_3az |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Music |date=1973 |isbn=0-672-51662-4 |url-access=registration|page=154|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]}}</ref> Gershwin is said to have been attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he could not teach him, saying, "Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Schiff |first=David |author-link=David Schiff |date=October 1, 1998 |title=Misunderstanding Gershwin |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/misunderstanding-gershwin/377252/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215222801/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/misunderstanding-gershwin/377252/ |archive-date=Dec 15, 2018 |access-date=December 11, 2018 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour. To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend [[E. Robert Schmitz|Robert Schmitz]], a pianist Ravel had met during the war, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $10,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.<ref name="Goss">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bolerolifeofmaur1940goss |title=Bolero: the life of Maurice Ravel |last=Goss |first=Madeleine |publisher=New York, H.

Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during a party held for Ravel's birthday by [[Éva Gauthier]].<ref name=Burton>{{Cite web |url=https://csosoundsandstories.org/fascinatin-rhythm-when-ravel-met-gershwin-in-jazz-age-new-york/ |title=Fascinatin' rhythm: When Ravel met Gershwin in Jazz Age New York |last=Burton |first=Louise |date=May 26, 2015 |website=CSO Sounds & Stories |publisher=[[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] |access-date=December 11, 2018 |archive-date=January 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121135409/https://csosoundsandstories.org/fascinatin-rhythm-when-ravel-met-gershwin-in-jazz-age-new-york/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ravel's tour reignited Gershwin's desire to return to Paris, which he and his brother [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] did after meeting Ravel.<ref name="Gerswhin.com" /> Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to [[Nadia Boulanger]] caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris. Yet after he played for her, she told him she could not teach him. Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students: "What could I give you that you haven't already got?"<ref name="Spycket1992">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-VcUAeWQr0C&pg=PA71|title=Nadia Boulanger|author=Jérôme Spycket|publisher=Pendragon Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-945193-38-8|pages=71–73}}</ref><ref name="Pollack2007" /> This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F.

Gershwin based ''An American in Paris'' on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne",<ref name="Gerswhin.com">{{Cite web |url=http://gershwin.com/publications/an-american-in-paris-concert-work/ |title=An American in Paris |website=Gershwin Enterprises |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}</ref> written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. Gershwin called it "a rhapsodic ballet"; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.<ref name="JablonskiStewart1958">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gershwinyearsgeo00jabl|url-access=registration|title=The Gershwin Years: George And Ira|author1=Edward Jablonski|author-link=Edward Jablonski|author2=Lawrence D.

Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere."<ref name="Pollack2007">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA431|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|author=Howard Pollack|author-link=Howard Pollack|date=January 15, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93314-9|pages=119, 431–440}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' performance material|url=https://www.schott-music.com/en/an-american-in-paris-no251041.html|access-date=2022-12-12|publisher=[[Schott Music]]}}</ref>

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|A–B–A format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio".<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Van Dyke|first=Joseph M.|year=2011|title=George Gershwin's An American in Paris for Two Pianos: A Critical Score Study and Performance Guide|type=Doctoral thesis|location=Columbus, Ohio|publisher=OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291|access-date=September 14, 2017|archive-date=September 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914172912/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291|url-status=dead}}</ref> The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]].<ref name=Burton /> This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final "Grandioso".

Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-09-08 |title=Who Could Ask For Anything More |url=https://smtd.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?parallax-sections=who-could-ask-for-anything-more |access-date=2022-12-12 |website=The Gershwin Initiative Website}}</ref>

Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than Gershwin's [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]].{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[César Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere.{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Gershwin responded to the critics:

{{Blockquote|It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.<ref name="Pollack2007" />}}

A major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments: alto, tenor and baritone; the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments.{{efn|1=Compare the original 1930 publication and Frank Campbell-Watson revision, both published by New World Music Corporation (New York); the date on both publications is 1930, although the revision is ca. 1942.

==Preservation status==
On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score would be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=New, critical edition of George and Ira Gershwin's works to be compiled|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=September 14, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

Two [[urtext edition]]s of the work were published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson were withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music were re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.<ref>{{cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' Urtext | url=https://www.bnote.de/?set=werk_detail&kompid=246&bnnr=16963&lc=en|website=Bnote.de |access-date=December 14, 2015}}</ref>

On September 9, 2017, The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by Mark Clague, director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan.

''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded.<ref>{{Cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' by George Gershwin|url=https://www.whosampled.com/George-Gershwin/An-American-in-Paris/ |access-date=2022-12-12|website=[[WhoSampled]]}}</ref> The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D, and a lower A.<ref name="nytimes1" />

The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937, Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}
