The earliest known certain ancestor of "A" is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],<ref name="Britannica">{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}</ref> which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]<ref name=Coll>{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}</ref> influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]‚Äîthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter‚Äîso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the eighth century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

=== Typographic variants ===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=Americana>{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>

At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the ninth century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=Americana/>

[[File:Road sign on the R639 north of Urlingford, Ireland - 20090502.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign in Ireland, showing the Irish "Latin alpha" form of "a" in lower and upper case forms.]]
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]]; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ("…ë"). This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.<ref name="Britannica"/> The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").<ref name=Americana/> Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms as "single decker a" and "double decker a" respectively.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' ("…ë"), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

== Use in writing systems ==
[[File:Pronunciation of the name of the letter ‚ü®a‚ü© in European languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, /a/ and /aÀê/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|√§}}, {{IPAblink|√¶}} and {{IPAblink|…ë}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]

=== English ===
{{further|Pronunciation of English ‚ü®a‚ü©}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/√¶/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/…ëÀê/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;<ref name=Coll/>
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/e…™/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) ‚Äì this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';<ref name="Britannica"/>
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref> However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}) and [[French language|French]], the second most common in Spanish, and the most common in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. About 8.167% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}};<ref>{{Cite web|title=Letter frequency (English)|url=http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English|access-date=2022-01-03|website=en.algoritmy.net|language=en|archive-date=2021-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304152631/http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English|url-status=live}}</ref> the number is around 7.636% in French,<ref>{{cite web|title=Corpus de Thomas Temp√©|url=http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9|language=fr|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194046/http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9|archive-date=2007-09-30|access-date=2007-06-15|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 11.525% in Spanish,<ref>{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Fletcher|title=Secret and Urgent: The story of codes and ciphers|publisher=Blue Ribbon Books|year=1942|location=Garden City, NY|pages=254‚Äì5|oclc=795065}}</ref> and 14.634% for Portuguese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequ√™ncia da ocorr√™ncia de letras no Portugu√™s|url=http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues|language=pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803182254/http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues|archive-date=2009-08-03|access-date=2009-06-16|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Other languages ===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|√§]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|…ë]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[√Å]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

=== Other systems ===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|√§}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|…ë}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

== Other uses ==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics. Moreover, in 1637, [[Ren√© Descartes]] "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c",<ref>Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'', (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> and this convention is still often followed, especially in elementary algebra.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.<ref name=Americana/> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.<ref name=Coll/>

"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A‚àí, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Ciani & Sheldon|2010|pp=99‚Äì100}}</ref>

"A" is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean "not" or "without" (from Greek).

In English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", is an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]], used to introduce noun phrases.

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,<ref name=Coll/> or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Luciani |first=Jen√© |title=The Bra Book: The Fashion Formula to Finding the Perfect Bra |date=2009 |publisher=Benbella Books |isbn=9781933771946 |location=Dallas, TX |pages=13 |language=en |oclc=317453115}}</ref>
